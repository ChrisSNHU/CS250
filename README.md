### 1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Interpreting user needs involves gathering requirements through various methods such as interviews, surveys, and observations. Creating “user stories” is a crucial technique in this process, as it allows developers to articulate user needs in a simple, understandable format. Each user story typically follows the structure: “As a [type of user], I want [goal] so that [reason]”. This format helps prioritize features based on user value and ensures that the development team remains focused on delivering functionality that meets real user needs.

### 2. How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

My approach to developing programs is iterative and incremental, emphasizing collaboration and flexibility. I aim to incorporate Agile methodologies such as Scrum and Kanban into my future development work. These processes promote regular feedback, continuous improvement, and adaptive planning. By breaking down projects into manageable sprints and holding daily stand-ups, I can ensure that the team remains aligned and responsive to changes in requirements or priorities.

### 3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member in software development means actively contributing to the team’s goals while fostering a collaborative environment. This includes effective communication, being open to feedback, and supporting colleagues in problem-solving. A good team member also takes responsibility for their tasks, shares knowledge, and is willing to help others. Ultimately, it involves a commitment to the team’s success and a willingness to adapt to the dynamics of the group.
